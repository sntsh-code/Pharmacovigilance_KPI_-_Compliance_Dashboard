Pharmacovigilance KPI & Compliance Dashboard
--------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Pharmacovigilance KPI & Compliance Dashboard Project — an analytical initiative focused on enhancing transparency, compliance, and efficiency in drug safety monitoring.

This project was designed to evaluate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) in Pharmacovigilance, helping identify trends in case processing, regulatory compliance, and product-level safety. Using real-world-inspired data, it transforms raw case records into actionable insights that support evidence-based decision-making in patient safety and regulatory operations.

Tools & Technologies Used
--------------------------

Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, processing, and KPI calculation.
Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization.
Pivot Tables & DAX Functions: For KPI aggregation and performance comparison.
Data Source: Simulated Pharmacovigilance case dataset (151 records).

Project Overview
----------------

The dashboard integrates metrics such as case volume by region, average processing time, serious vs. non-serious case distribution, product-wise safety ratios, and 15-day compliance rate. Built using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, it provides an interactive interface for monitoring performance trends and improving operational efficiency across global regions.

Objectives
----------
Evaluate timeliness and efficiency of case processing.
Assess compliance with the 15-day regulatory reporting standard.
Compare serious vs. non-serious case handling efficiency.
Identify regional disparities and optimize resource allocation.
Strengthen data-driven decision-making for patient safety.

Expected Outcomes
-----------------

Clear visibility into regional case workloads and efficiency.
Identification of bottlenecks affecting compliance and turnaround times.
Enhanced understanding of product-level safety profiles.
Improved workflow planning and regulatory performance monitoring.

Key Findings
------------

Middle East reported the highest case volume (19.9%), while Africa had the lowest.
Africa (15 days) and South America (14.8 days) showed the longest processing times; Asia-Pacific (12 days) was fastest.
Serious cases averaged 14.26 days, while non-serious cases averaged 13.43 days.
56% of cases met compliance within 15 days; 44% exceeded the limit.
Oncurex (48.28%) and Respivax (37.5%) had the highest serious case proportions.

Recommendations
---------------
Strengthen regional workflows and provide focused training.
Automate compliance alerts for near-deadline cases.
Optimize team allocation based on case volume trends.
Increase surveillance for products with higher serious case ratios.
Conduct quarterly KPI reviews to sustain process improvement.
